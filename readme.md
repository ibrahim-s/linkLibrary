application key, to add a link by entering the url, label and optionaly the about of the link.  
*	Standing on any link in this list, pressing enter on it will open it with the default browser.  
*	Tabing on that dialog you can access the about of the link(some information about the link ) if present, a button to show the source url, another button that gives you the option to open the link with several browsers if found on your computer.  
*	And using the filter control there, you can filter the links that contain specific words or phrases in the library.
*	Stand on the link you want in this list, and press the context menu.  
*	From there you can add, edit, move link to another library, remove that link or all.  
*	Now do you want to import a json library, or export any library as json or html file, Yes you can  
*	For instance to export a library, stand on the library you want to export and press the contact menu, arrow down once to Export library as, choose the type of file you want to be exported, json or html and press enter.

*	In the menu of the new window, go to Import and Backup submenu, then to Import Bookmarks from HTMLâ€¦ and press enter.  
*	Navigate through the dialog opened to the html file and select it. After that an entry or folder having the same name of the imported library will be found in the firefox bookmarks menu including all links of the imported library in it.

*	Worth noting that creating the folder to host the data files in the home user directory, helps that all instances of the addon on the computer can share the same files or data base  
*	and choosing another path like dropbox for example, will give the user the ability to share the same folder or data base with instances of the addon on another computer that uses the same dropbox account.
